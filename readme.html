<p><strong><a name="information">Information:</a></strong><br>
  This script is designed to take forums posts from one or more forum categories 
  and arrange them in a news format. Currently it works with vBulletin, Invision 
  Power Board (ipb), Web Burning Board (wbb), YaBB SE, Simple Machines Forum (SMF), phpBB, 
  MyBB, and primitive RSS/XML sources. It will display a specific amount of posts on a page as well as 
  give recent headlines from one or multiple forums. News post display contains 
  title, news text, comment number, author, date, avatar, etc. It will automatically 
  detect and display all smilies displayed in the forum as well as popular bbcode.
  Lastly, the script has caching support, resulting in very fast display.
  All aspects of the script can be easily edited from within the Admin Control 
  Panel.</p>
<p>I release these scripts for free as most of the types of scripts we create 
  are usually not available to the public for free. While I do not <em>require</em> 
  anything in return, I would really appreciate a link to EP-Dev.com on your 
  links page :).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="whatsnew">What's New in Version 2.0:</a></strong><br>
  - Added full cache support. The script can now use output that has been cached
  instead of having to pull all the news from the database every time. This of course
  speeds up the script and saves on many database queries. The cache time can be set
  from within the Admin Panel.<br>
  <br>
  - Multiple Forum Support: The script can now pull posts from an infinite number 
  of forums. Additionally, these forums can be of mixed and matched types. This 
  means that it is now possible to pull posts from Invision Power Board and vBulletin 
  and display by date as news.<br>
  <br>
  - Multiple Layout Support: Multiple layouts can now be handled by the script. 
  This means that completely separate layouts (all templates including forum post, 
  headlines, bbcode, ect.) can now be entered in. Combined with multiple forum 
  support, this opens up the awesome possibility of pulling news from multiple 
  forums of different sites and displaying the combined news across an array of 
  sites in that site's layout.<br>
  <br>
  - Added Avatar Support, new BBcode recognition, as well as new forum support!.
  <br>
  - Added basic RSS Support. The script can now pull from rss feeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="install">Upgrade Instructions:</a></strong></p>
<p>1. BACKUP your forum-news/config/ folder.<br>
  2. Upload the entire forum-news folder <b>except</b> for the forum-news/config/ folder to your website.<br>
  3. Visit forum-news/admin/index.php in your web browser and follow the on-screen instructions.<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="install">Install Instructions (easy &amp; recommended):</a></strong></p>
<p>1. Upload entire forum-news folder to your website.<br>
  2. You must chmod 0666 (read &amp; write all) the files news.php, config/config.php, 
  and config/template.php. Chmod the cache folder to 0777 (read/write/execute all). This 
  can usually be done in your ftp program by right clicking on the file/folder. <br>
  2. Visit forum-news/admin/index.php in your web browser.<br>
  3. Since this is your first time logging in, login by typing &quot;admin&quot; 
  into the username field and leaving the password field blank.<br>
  4. You will be taken to the change username &amp; password page. Please change 
  your username &amp; password at this time.<br>
  5. Login again to the Administration Panel and continue through the steps listed 
  on the main page. The last step should be the Generate Code step, where code 
  is generated for you to place on the page you want to display news and/or headlines 
  on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a name="install">Install Instructions (manual &amp; advanced):</a></strong></p>
<p> <strong><font color="#FF0000">IF YOU ARE NOT USING THE ADMINISTRATION PANEL, 
  YOU SHOULD DELETE the admin/ folder!</font></strong><br>
  Before you begin: Chmod cache folder to 0777 if you plan to use cache.<br>
  1. Edit config/config.php file with your database settings, urls, and default 
  category ids of your forum that you want the news script to pull news from.<br>
  2. Edit the $this-&gt;absolute_path in news.php, setting it to your absolute 
  path value.<br>
  3. Edit config/template.php and format it to how you want your news to be displayed</p>
<p>4. Insert the following under the &lt;body&gt; tag of any pages you wish for 
  news or headlines to be displayed on:<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">&lt;?php include_once(&quot;/absolute/path/to/forum-news/news.php&quot;); 
  ?&gt;</font></p>
<p>5. To display news on your page, insert the following:<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">&lt;?php </font><font color="#FF0000">$forum_obj = new 
  EP_Dev_Forum_News();<br>
  $forum_obj-&gt;display_News(); ?&gt;</font> (you can also specify non-default 
  ids and news numbers... see examples.php for examples).</p>
<p>6. To display headlines on your page, insert the following:<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">&lt;?php $forum_obj = new EP_Dev_Forum_News();<br>
  $forum_obj-&gt;display_News(); ?&gt;</font> (you can also specify non-default 
  ids and news numbers... see examples.php for examples).</p>
<p>The display_News() accepts four arguments:<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">$forum_obj-&gt;display_News(NUMBER TO DISPLAY, FORUM CATEGORY 
  IDS, FORUM IDS, TEMPLATE IDS);</font></p>
<p>For <strong>example</strong>: <font color="#FF0000">$forum_obj-&gt;display_News(&quot;10&quot;, 
  &quot;2&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;2&quot;);</font> would display 10 news items 
  from category id 2 of forum 0 (in config.php) using template 2 (from template.php). 
</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>any argument can also be left out</strong>: <font color="#FF0000">$forum_obj-&gt;display_News(&quot;&quot;, 
  &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;2&quot;);</font> would display the default 
  number of news items of all default categories of all default forums using template 
  2.</p>
<p>This is how you would <strong>display multiple forums</strong> using default 
  categories: <font color="#FF0000">$forum_obj-&gt;display_News(&quot;&quot;, 
  &quot;&quot;, &quot;2,3&quot;, &quot;&quot;);</font> would display forum 1 and 
  forum 2 using their respective default categories with the default template 
  and the default number of news items.</p>
<p>You may also want to <strong>display specific category numbers and specific 
  forums</strong>. This can be accomplished using the <font color="#FF0000">|</font> 
  and the <font color="#FF0000">,</font> where <font color="#FF0000">|</font> 
  separates forums and <font color="#FF0000">,</font> separates category ids. 
  A good example then is <font color="#FF0000">$forum_obj-&gt;display_News(&quot;&quot;, 
  &quot;1,2,3|2,3,8,4&quot;, &quot;0,2&quot;, &quot;&quot;);</font> where we are 
  pulling both forum 0 and forum 2, but for forum 0 we are getting posts from 
  categories 1, 2, and 3 while in forum 2 we are getting posts from categories 
  2, 3, 8, and 4.</p>
<p>To sum up, I will give you perhaps the most complicated example you will run 
  into:<br>
  <font color="#FF0000">$forum_obj-&gt;display_News(&quot;23&quot;, &quot;1,2,3|2,3,8,4|8|3,2&quot;, 
  &quot;0,2,1,4&quot;, &quot;1&quot;);</font> would display 23 news items total. 
  The script will be pulling posts from categories 1, 2, and 3 for forum 0, categories 
  2, 3, 8, and 4 for forum 2, category 8 for forum 1, and categories 3 and 2 for 
  forum 4. The script will be using template 1 for the output. As you can see, 
  the order of forums or categories does not matter.</p>
<p>The <font color="#FF0000">display_Headlines()</font> uses the exact same methods 
  as <font color="#FF0000">display_News()</font>. Therefore all the above is applicable 
  to <font color="#FF0000">display_Headlines()</font> too! Like all EP-Dev scripts, 
  it is all very feature rich, with the ability to be used by both the novice 
  as well as those who require advanced features. If the above isn't enough customization 
  for you, open up news.php and take a look at the news() function.</p>
